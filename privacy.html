    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>TinyRests is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data when you use our nap schedule calculator.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Don't Collect</h2>
    <p>TinyRests is a simple calculator tool that does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. All calculations happen directly in your browser.</p>
    
    <h2>Local Storage</h2>
    <p>We use browser local storage only to remember your theme preference (light or dark mode). This information stays on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.</p>
    
    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>TinyRests does not use cookies to track you or collect any information about your usage patterns.</p>
    
    <h2>Shareable URLs</h2>
    <p>When you use the "Share" or "Copy Link" feature, the URL contains parameters that represent your input values (such as age, wake-up time, and bedtime). These parameters are only used to restore your calculator settings if you or someone you share the link with visits that URL.</p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>TinyRests may load common third-party libraries like Bootstrap for styling. These libraries are loaded directly from their CDNs and their usage is subject to their own privacy policies.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
